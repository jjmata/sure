# Repository Guidelines

## About Sure

Sure is a community-maintained fork of the Maybe Finance personal finance app (now archived). This is a Rails-based personal finance and wealth management application that can be self-hosted with Docker or run locally for development. The app helps users track accounts, transactions, investments, and financial goals across multiple currencies.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Code: `app/` (Rails MVC, services, jobs, mailers, components), JS in `app/javascript/`, styles/assets in `app/assets/` (Tailwind, images, fonts).
- Config: `config/`, environment examples in `.env.local.example` and `.env.test.example`.
- Data: `db/` (migrations, seeds), fixtures in `test/fixtures/`.
- Tests: `test/` mirroring `app/` (e.g., `test/models/*_test.rb`).
- Tooling: `bin/` (project scripts), `docs/` (guides), `public/` (static), `lib/` (shared libs).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Setup: `cp .env.local.example .env.local && bin/setup` — install deps, set DB, prepare app.
- Run app: `bin/dev` — starts Rails server and asset/watchers via `Procfile.dev`.
- Test suite: `bin/rails test` — run all Minitest tests (primary test framework); add `TEST=test/models/user_test.rb` to target a file.
- RSpec: `bundle exec rspec` — run RSpec tests (used only for API documentation generation via rswag).
- Lint Ruby: `bin/rubocop` — style checks (uses rubocop-rails-omakase); add `-A` to auto-correct safe cops.
- Lint ERB: `bundle exec erb_lint ./app/**/*.erb -a` — ERB linting with auto-correct.
- Lint/format JS/CSS: `npm run lint` and `npm run format` — uses Biome for JavaScript.
- Security scan: `bin/brakeman` — static analysis for common Rails issues.

### Requirements
- Ruby 3.4.7 (see `.ruby-version`)
- PostgreSQL >9.3 (latest stable recommended)
- Redis >5.4 (latest stable recommended)
- Node.js (for JavaScript tooling)

### Key Technologies
- **Backend**: Rails 7.2.2, PostgreSQL, Redis, Sidekiq
- **Frontend**: Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus), ViewComponents, Tailwind CSS v4.x
- **Testing**: Minitest (primary), RSpec (API docs only), Mocha (mocking), VCR (HTTP recording)
- **Linting**: RuboCop (rubocop-rails-omakase), ERB Lint, Biome (JavaScript)
- **Integrations**: Plaid (bank syncing), Stripe (payments), OpenAI (AI features)
- **Icons**: Lucide (via `icon` helper)
- **Component Development**: Lookbook (viewable at `/design-system` in dev mode)

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Ruby: 2-space indent, `snake_case` for methods/vars, `CamelCase` for classes/modules. Follow Rails conventions for folders and file names.
- Views: ERB checked by `erb-lint` (see `.erb_lint.yml`). Avoid heavy logic in views; prefer helpers/components.
- JavaScript: `lowerCamelCase` for vars/functions, `PascalCase` for classes/components. Let Biome format code.
- Commit small, cohesive changes; keep diffs focused.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: Minitest (primary test framework for Rails). RSpec is used ONLY for API documentation generation (rswag) in the `spec/` directory. Name files `*_test.rb` and mirror `app/` structure.
- Run: `bin/rails test` locally and ensure green before pushing.
- Fixtures/VCR: Use `test/fixtures` and existing VCR cassettes for HTTP. Prefer unit tests plus focused integration tests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Imperative subject ≤ 72 chars (e.g., "Add account balance validation"). Include rationale in body and reference issues (`#123`).
- PRs: Clear description, linked issues, screenshots for UI changes, and migration notes if applicable. Ensure CI passes, tests added/updated, and `rubocop`/Biome are clean.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets. Start from `.env.local.example`; use `.env.local` for development only.
- Run `bin/brakeman` before major PRs. Prefer environment variables over hard-coded values.

## Providers: Pending Transactions and FX Metadata (SimpleFIN/Plaid)

- Pending detection
  - SimpleFIN: pending when provider sends `pending: true`, or when `posted` is blank/0 and `transacted_at` is present.
  - Plaid: pending when Plaid sends `pending: true` (stored at `transaction.extra["plaid"]["pending"]` for bank/credit transactions imported via `PlaidEntry::Processor`).
- Storage (extras)
  - Provider metadata lives on `Transaction#extra`, namespaced (e.g., `extra["simplefin"]["pending"]`).
  - SimpleFIN FX: `extra["simplefin"]["fx_from"]`, `extra["simplefin"]["fx_date"]`.
- UI
  - Shows a small “Pending” badge when `transaction.pending?` is true.
- Variability
  - Some providers don’t expose pendings; in that case nothing is shown.
- Configuration (default-off)
  - SimpleFIN runtime toggles live in `config/initializers/simplefin.rb` via `Rails.configuration.x.simplefin.*`.
  - ENV-backed keys:
    - `SIMPLEFIN_INCLUDE_PENDING=1` (forces `pending=1` on SimpleFIN fetches when caller didn’t specify a `pending:` arg)
    - `SIMPLEFIN_DEBUG_RAW=1` (logs raw payload returned by SimpleFIN)

### Provider support notes

- SimpleFIN: supports pending + FX metadata; stored under `extra["simplefin"]`.
- Plaid: supports pending when the upstream Plaid payload includes `pending: true`; stored under `extra["plaid"]`.
- Plaid investments: investment transactions currently do not store pending metadata.
- Lunchflow: does not currently store pending metadata.
- Manual/CSV imports: no pending concept.
